I'm a computer systems researcher and Assistant Professor at the [Department of Software Engineering](https://www.ksi.mff.cuni.cz), 
[Faculty of Mathematics and Physics](https://www.mff.cuni.cz/en) of [Charles University](https://cuni.cz/UKEN-1.html) in Prague.
I focus on building and analyzing high-performance, scalable software. 
My core research investigates large-scale distributed graph processing and the underlying performance mechanics of concurrent systems through rigorous analysis and benchmarking. I bring industry and academic experience from my past work at Oracle Labs and Inria Paris.
